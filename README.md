# SDLC - SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
- a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software.
- a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step
- ** goal of the SDLC life cycle model ** is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user’s requirements.

- The SDLC Model involves six phases or stages while developing any software.

### TOP 5 MODELS

1) waterfall model
- fundamental model of the software development life cycle.
- very simple model
- The waterfall model is not in practice anymore, but it is the basis for all other SDLC models
- It is characterized by a structured, sequential approach to project management and software development.

## Example of Waterfall Model

### Real-Life Example of Spiral Model: Developing an Online Banking System

1) Analysis
This phase will be tasked with gathering all the information available on customer banking requirements, transactions, security protocols, and devising the different parameters that’ll be used for determining the core functionalities of the online banking system, such as account management, fund transfers, bill payments, and loan applications.

2) Design
In this example of the Waterfall Model, the design phase is all about fine-tuning the parameters established in the analysis phase. The system’s architecture will be designed to manage sensitive data securely, avoid transactional errors, and ensure high performance. This includes database structure, user interface design, encryption protocols, and multi-factor authentication to protect user accounts.

3) Implementation
This all-important phase involves doing dummy runs of the online banking system with a provisional set of banking transactions and customer data to see the accuracy with which the system can handle transactions, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and bill payments. These results should be matched with results from banking experts and auditors who ensure compliance with banking regulations and accuracy in transactions.

4) Testing
As with any example of the Waterfall Model, the testing phase is about ensuring that all features of the online banking system function smoothly. This includes testing for security vulnerabilities, transaction accuracy, performance under heavy load, and user interface responsiveness. Special attention is given to testing secure logins, data encryption, and ensuring that sensitive data is handled correctly throughout the system.

5) Maintenance
In the final phase, the online banking system should be checked for any necessary updates or alterations that may be required, besides the expected inclusion of new features or changes in banking regulations. Regular updates will also be needed for security patches, performance improvements, and the addition of new services like mobile banking, instant loans, or personalized financial advice.

### Advantages of Waterfall Model

* Easy to Understand
* Indvidual processing
* properly defined
* properly documented
* clear milestones
* reinforces good habits
* working

  ### Disadvantage

  * no feedback path
  * difficult to accomodate change requests
  * no overlapping of phases - new phase starts only after completion of previous phase
  * limited flexibility - linear approach , once phase is completed difficult to go back to previous phase
  * limited stakeholder development - only involved in requirements and analysis phase
  * late defect detection -
  testing done only at the end of development
* lengthy development cycle - since there is no overlapping

### 2) Agile Development Model

  - designed to help a project adapt quickly to change requests
  - quick project completion
  - fitting the process to the project and removing activities that may not be essential for specific project
  - anything waste of time is avoided

#### Steps in the Agile Model

The agile model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models. The steps involve in agile SDLC models are: 

   Requirement gathering
   Design the Requirements
   Construction / Iteration
   Testing / Quality Assurance
   Deployment
   Feedback
