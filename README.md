# SDLC - SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
- a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software.
- a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step
- ``` goal of the SDLC life cycle model ``` is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user’s requirements.

### TOP 5 MODELS

1) waterfall model
- fundamental model of the software development life cycle.
- very simple model
- The waterfall model is not in practice anymore, but it is the basis for all other SDLC models
- It is characterized by a structured, sequential approach to project management and software development.

## Example of Waterfall Model

### Real-Life Example of Spiral Model: Developing an Online Banking System

1) Analysis
This phase will be tasked with gathering all the information available on customer banking requirements, transactions, security protocols, and devising the different parameters that’ll be used for determining the core functionalities of the online banking system, such as account management, fund transfers, bill payments, and loan applications.

2) Design
In this example of the Waterfall Model, the design phase is all about fine-tuning the parameters established in the analysis phase. The system’s architecture will be designed to manage sensitive data securely, avoid transactional errors, and ensure high performance. This includes database structure, user interface design, encryption protocols, and multi-factor authentication to protect user accounts.

3) Implementation
This all-important phase involves doing dummy runs of the online banking system with a provisional set of banking transactions and customer data to see the accuracy with which the system can handle transactions, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and bill payments. These results should be matched with results from banking experts and auditors who ensure compliance with banking regulations and accuracy in transactions.

4) Testing
As with any example of the Waterfall Model, the testing phase is about ensuring that all features of the online banking system function smoothly. This includes testing for security vulnerabilities, transaction accuracy, performance under heavy load, and user interface responsiveness. Special attention is given to testing secure logins, data encryption, and ensuring that sensitive data is handled correctly throughout the system.

5) Maintenance
In the final phase, the online banking system should be checked for any necessary updates or alterations that may be required, besides the expected inclusion of new features or changes in banking regulations. Regular updates will also be needed for security patches, performance improvements, and the addition of new services like mobile banking, instant loans, or personalized financial advice.

### Advantages of Waterfall Model

* Easy to Understand
* Indvidual processing
* properly defined
* properly documented
* clear milestones
* reinforces good habits
* working

  ### Disadvantage

  * no feedback path
  * difficult to accomodate change requests
  * no overlapping of phases - new phase starts only after completion of previous phase
  * limited flexibility - linear approach , once phase is completed difficult to go back to previous phase
  * limited stakeholder development - only involved in requirements and analysis phase
  * late defect detection -
  testing done only at the end of development
* lengthy development cycle - since there is no overlapping

### 2) Agile Development Model

  - designed to help a project adapt quickly to change requests
  - quick project completion
  - fitting the process to the project and removing activities that may not be essential for specific project
  - anything waste of time is avoided

#### Steps in the Agile Model

The agile model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models. The steps involve in agile SDLC models are: 

    * Requirement gathering
    * Design the requirements
    * construction / iteration
    * testing / quality assurance
        - unit testing  - tested module by module
        - integration testing - testing after integrating each module
        - system testing - system meets the requirements of user
    * deployment
    * feedback

### Principles of Agile Model

* establish close contact with customer during development
* frquent delivery of incremental versions of software to the customer respective in intervals of a few weeks
* Requirements changes requests from customers are encouraged and efficiently incorporated
* emphasis having efficient team members
* recommended to keep the team size small like (5 to 9) encourages colloboration and environment
* usually deploys ** Pair Programming ** one does coding and the other reviews the coding
* relies on software developement rather than comprehensive documentation

### Characteristics of agile process

* adaptable to technical and environmental changes  , means if any changes occurs , agile process must accomodate them
* must be incremental , which means each development the increment should contain some functionalities .
* customer feedback must be used to create next increment of process
* software increment must be delivered in ahort span of time
* must be iterative , so that each increment can be evaluated regularly

### Scrum 

  - a popular framework that is used whenever we want to develop complex products, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland are known as the people who developed Scrum.
  - type of Agile framework
  - teams use to self-organize tasks and work towards a common goal
  - people can address common adaptive problems while the productivity and creativity of delivering products are at highest possible value .
  - a management framework that team use to self-organize and work towards common goal .
  - witerative and incremental approach used in scrum allows the teams to adapt the changing requirements .

### Silent features of scrum

- light-weight framework
- emphasizes self-organization
- simple to understand
- helps team to work together

  ###       LifeCycle Of Scrum

1 ) Sprint
    - fixed length iteration , a set of tasks must be completed .
    - iterative development and continuous improvement
    - each sprint lasts from 1 to 4 weeks ( begins with planning , includes daily stand up meetings for progress updates , and endss with a review)
    - time box of 1 month or less
    - new sprint starts immediately after completion of previous sprint .

2 ) Sprint review
    - if product still have some ``` non-achievable features ``` , checked in this stage and then passed to sprint retrospective stage

3 ) Sprint Retrospective 
    - key takeaway from sprint
    - what things went well and what things didn't ?
    - what problem were faced during sprint ?
    - analyse merits and demerits faced during sprint
    - usually lasts for 1-2 hrs
    - quality or status of product wis checked
    
    ``` Product Backlog ``` : according to prioritization features the product is organized

4 ) Sprint Backlog 
    - all team will be agrees on the list , which decides what the tasks which , development team will finish the sprint 
    - 2 parts
      * product assigned features to sprint
      * sprint planning meeting
      
  ``` Backlog ``` 
      - a lis of tasks needs to do before product is ready
      - PO makes this list and give it to SM and team
      - it is made up of users stories , all about what features and requirements list will gave the client
    ``` Daily Scrum ```
      - lead by scrum master which collects every day for small meetings
      - all they talk about what they have done ? , what are they currently working on ? any problem facing during the work
      - meeting lasts for ``` 15 mins ``` and discussion revolve around all team members .
      1) what i did yesterday
      2) are there any problem i'm facing
      3) what i will do today
### Sprint

- a sprint is a short and fixed time frame during which a specific set of tasks are meant to be performed". 
- Sprint in Agile project management, is a fixed-length iteration where a defined set of tasks must be completed.
- Agile development methodology focuses on Adaptive planning and change management.
- It focuses on developing and deploying the working software quickly in an iterative manner.
- This means that instead of developing the product entirely in one go, the product is made iteratively in multiple short and incremental cycles.
- An Agile project will be broken down into a certain number of sprints, each sprint lasting for a fixed duration of time. Usually, each sprint runs for 2–4 weeks.
- A Sprint Planning Meeting occurs before the start of every sprint.
- That meeting defines what set of items could be developed and delivered in the upcoming sprint.
- During every planning meeting, a ** Sprint Backlog ** is created that has a subset of items from the original Product
- ** Backlog ** that the team aims to achieve and develop in the current sprint.

### Sprint Roles, Artifacts and Ceremonies

- Sprint is just a process in the scrum framework
- tasks is divided the workflow into small iterations
- sprint team is no different from scrum team
- scrum is responsible for carrying out sprint

### a scrum sprint involves 3 roles.

1) Product Owner (PO)
   - PO is the face of organization
   - responsible for all interaction and communication of stakeholders by ensuring the right balance among all
   - PO is responsible for release management of the model
   - he tends to whether the product needs to delivered in iteration or continuous delivery
   - he guides which functionality has to be delivered first and which ones gives highest priority


2) Scrum Master (SM)

   - acts as a leader who guides the development team
   - faciliates the set of development activities done by the team
   - SM is responsible fo letting the person ooutside the team understand the scrum practices
   - sm focuses on scrum principles and values and coaches the team memebers in every single sprint activity

3) Development Team (DT)

     - DT consists of software engineers  , UX developers , testers , quality asscurances engineers , architect and business analysts .
     - professional members who have responsibility to get the development job done .
     - they take sprint responsibilities and are responsible fro sprint estimation tasks .
  

### Scrum Sprint Cycle

  - activities mentioned above is termed as scrum sprint cycle .
  - throughout the sprint effective colloboration and coordination on the sprint goals are crucila for success .
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c308c9f7-ec68-4c76-a0c6-1b83627c5316)
    - Product development is not just achieved through 1 single sprint. The entire fully functioning Software product undergoes a set of several sprints. 


### Sprint workflow and process

1) Backlog
  - a list of tasks need to do before the product is ready.
  - The product owner makes this list, and after that they gives it to the scrum master and team.
  - it is made up of user stories, all about what features and requirement list will gave the client.

2) Sprint Planning
  - team focus on to the top things which are needs in user 
3) Sprint backlog
4) Sprint
5) Daily Scrum
6) Outcome
7) Sprint end


### Scrum productivity tools
Today, there are various tools which are available to help teams to follow the Scrum or sprint methodology in proper manner.

Some of are listed bellow:
  
 * Jira
 * nTask
 * QuickScrum
 * ScrumDo
 * Scrumwise
 * Vivify Scrum
